# Task ID: Version Control System


Mentors : Siddharth Bhat and Vinayak Vatsalya J



What I have understood from the Problem Statement 
We have to build a program in any programming language of our choice and that program should be capable of doing the things mentioned below
* Git Init - Create an empty repository in local.
* Git Add - Add files to staging area in that local repo using SHA-1 hashing function.
* Git Commit - Commit / Lock your changes.
* `Bonus` Git Push - Push your commited code from your local to your GitHub account.


Features I have implemented 
* Basic CMD commands like
  * cd - Required to change Directory to necessary locations
    * Valid Command
      * **cd {complete path of the desired file/folder location}**
  * mkdir - make Directory if need in that location
    * Valid Command
      *  **mkdir {name of the folder/directory needs to be created}**
  * ipconfig
  * dir - List all files / Directories present in that location
  * pwd
  * help
* Git Commands
  * Git Init - Initializes a .git file in your desired file location
  * Git Add - Adds all files in staging area
    * Valid Commands
      *  git add -A
      *  git add --all
      *  git add .
* Git Commit - Commits all changes it also shows "Working Tree Clean" if no data was changed
  * Valid Commands
    * git commit -u -m   *Message*   ->  **Without Double Coats**
    * git commit -u  *z*   ->  **Only used when there is no commit message**



Programming language used - `JAVA` 


Technologies used - `JAVA` `Core Java Concepts` `File Handeling` and `SHA-1`

 **Only availabe for Windows and Linux Users**.
